## Development Workflow

Every change — no matter how small — follows this flow:

### 1. Create a branch

Branch names should reflect the type and scope of the change:

```bash
git checkout -b fix/null-value-credential-serializer
git checkout -b feat/retry-logic-5xx
git checkout -b chore/bump-httpx-0-27
```

### 2. Make your change

Keep changes small and focused. One logical change per commit.
Add or update tests in `tests/` to cover your change.

### 3. Check locally

Run all pre-commit hooks before pushing:

```bash
make check       # pre-commit run --all-files
make test        # pytest with coverage
```

Both commands must pass cleanly before opening a pull request.

### 4. Commit

Follow the [Conventional Commits](#commit-convention) format.
The `conventional-pre-commit` hook will reject commits that do not comply.

### 5. Open a pull request

- Target branch: `main`
- The CI pipeline runs automatically on every push
- The pull request cannot be merged until CI is green and at least one review is approved

### 6. Merge

Merges use **squash merge** to keep `main` linear.
The branch is deleted after merge.

### 7. Release

`release-please` analyses commits on `main` after each merge and either:
- Updates the pending release pull request, or
- Creates a new one if none exists.

Merging the release pull request triggers the CD pipeline:
creates the git tag, publishes the GitHub Release, and uploads to PyPI.

---

## Commit Convention

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
The format is:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types

| Type | When to use | Version bump |
|---|---|---|
| `feat` | New feature | `minor` |
| `fix` | Bug fix | `patch` |
| `chore` | Maintenance, dependencies, config | none |
| `docs` | Documentation only | none |
| `refactor` | Code change with no behaviour change | none |
| `test` | Add or update tests | none |
| `ci` | CI/CD pipeline changes | none |
| `build` | Build system or packaging | none |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | none |

### Scope

Use the module name as scope:

```
feat(client):     src/netdoc_sdk/client.py
fix(models):      src/netdoc_sdk/models.py
fix(exceptions):  src/netdoc_sdk/exceptions.py
chore(builders):  src/netdoc_sdk/builders.py
```

### Examples

```bash
# New feature → 0.1.9 → 0.2.0
git commit -m "feat(client): add retry logic on 5xx responses"

# Bug fix → 0.1.9 → 0.1.10
git commit -m "fix(models): handle null value in credential serializer"

# Dependencies
git commit -m "chore(deps): bump httpx from 0.26 to 0.27"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs: add authentication example to README"

# Breaking change → 0.1.9 → 1.0.0
git commit -m "feat!: remove deprecated v1 authentication method"

# Breaking change with migration notes
git commit -m "feat(auth): replace API key with OAuth2 token

BREAKING CHANGE: ApiKeyClient removed, use OAuth2Client instead.
See the migration guide: https://github.com/dainok/netdoc/wiki/migration-v2"
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run full test suite with coverage report
make test

# Run a specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_001_normalize_base_url.py -v

# Run a specific test function
pytest tests/unit/test_001_normalize_base_url.py::test_trailing_slash -v

# Run only unit tests
pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Run with coverage and open the HTML report
pytest --cov=netdoc_sdk --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

The minimum required coverage is **80%**. The CI pipeline enforces this threshold
and will fail if it is not met.

---

## Code Quality

All checks are configured in `pyproject.toml` and run automatically on commit
via `pre-commit`. You can also run them manually:

```bash
# Run all hooks on all files (same as CI)
make check

# Run only the linter with autofix
ruff check . --fix

# Run only the formatter
ruff format .

# Run type checking
mypy src/

# Run security analysis
bandit -c pyproject.toml -r src/
```

### Tools in use

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ruff` | Linting and formatting (replaces flake8, black, isort, pyupgrade) |
| `mypy` | Static type checking |
| `bandit` | Security analysis |
| `markdownlint` | Markdown linting |
| `pre-commit` | Runs all of the above automatically on commit |

---

## Releasing

Releases are fully automated. As a contributor you do not need to manage
version numbers or changelogs manually.

### How it works

1. Every merge to `main` triggers `release-please`
2. It analyses commits since the last release and determines the next version
   according to Conventional Commits:
   - `fix:` → patch bump (`0.1.9 → 0.1.10`)
   - `feat:` → minor bump (`0.1.9 → 0.2.0`)
   - `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE` footer → major bump (`0.1.9 → 1.0.0`)
3. `release-please` opens or updates a release pull request with:
   - Updated version in `pyproject.toml`
   - Updated `CHANGELOG.md`
4. When the release pull request is merged, the CD pipeline:
   - Creates the git tag (e.g. `v0.1.10`)
   - Publishes the GitHub Release with release notes
   - Builds the wheel and sdist
   - Uploads the package to PyPI

> **Note:** `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `ci:`, and `refactor:` commits do not
> trigger a version bump on their own. They are included in the changelog under
> the next release caused by a `feat:` or `fix:` commit.
